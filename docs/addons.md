# Addons

To keep things tide, Ovee doesn't come with any modules by itself. Yet, we ship some official, ready-made modules that would help your workflow as a separate packages.

## Barba.js Plugin

A module that hooks [Barba.js v2](https://barba.js.org/) to your Ovee.js App.

### Installation

```shell
yarn add @ovee.js/barba

# or

npm install --save @ovee.js/barba
```

### Getting Started

The module is simply a wrapper around the excellent Barba.js. We try to keep everything raw, so you should simply follow the library's [docs](https://barba.js.org/docs/getstarted/intro/) to set up your markup and set proper options.

```js
import { App } from 'ovee.js';
import OveeBarba from '@ovee.js/barba';

import { defaultTransition } from 'transitions';

const root = document.body;
const app = new App();

app.use(OveeBarba, {
    transitions: [
        defaultTransition
    ],
    timeout: 20000,
    preventRunning: true,
    usePrefetch: true,
    hooks: {
        after() {
            if (global.dataLayer !== undefined) {
                try {
                    global.dataLayer.push({
                        event: 'content-view',
                        'content-name': global.location.pathname
                    });
                // eslint-disable-next-line no-empty
                } catch {}
            }
        }
    }

});

app.run(root);
```

### Available Options

The module's options object accepts same set of options that Barba would use. Additionally, you can set the following custom options:


| Option | Default Value | Description |
|:------ |:------------- |:----------- |
| `usePrefetch` | `true` | sets Barba's [Prefetch Plugin](https://barba.js.org/docs/plugins/prefetch/) on or off |
| `useCss` | `false` | sets Barba's [CSS Plugin](https://barba.js.org/docs/plugins/css/) on or off |
| `useRouter` | `false` | sets Barba's [Router Plugin](https://barba.js.org/docs/plugins/router/) on or off |
| `hooks` | `{}` | you can pass methods to hook into Barba's lifecycle globally. More in section [Hooks](#hooks) |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|:------ |:----------- |
| `$go(href: string, trigger?: Trigger, e?: LinkEvent | PopStateEvent)` | Tell Barba to go to a specific URL |
| `$prefetch(href: string)` | Prefetch the given URL |


### Hooks

You can add globall hooks callbacks in module options under `hooks` option. Every hook also emits global event on `$app` instance. Available hooks and theire events are:
 - `before` | event: `barba:before`
 - `beforeLeave` | event: `barba:before-leave`
 - `leave` | event: `barba:leave`

 - `enter` | event: `barba:enter`
 - `afterEnter` | event: `barba:after-enter`
 - `after` | event: `barba:after`

### Defining Custom Transitions

To define your transitions, just pass transition definitions to `transitions` array of the module config. We don't do anything with them by any meaning, so you shall just follow the [official docs](https://barba.js.org/docs/advanced/transitions/) to get more details.
